This is the code of Detail aware network with contrast attention

**Dataset**

Mobile phone screen surface defect segmentation dataset.

This dataset contains 3 types of surface defects: Oil, Scratch and Stain. It consists of 1200 images and 400 images for each defects. The defects are made by ourselves. The images are collected by industrial camera and the resolution is 1920×1080.The dataset is built and presented by Jian Zhang, Miaoju Ban (Open Lab on Human Robot Interaction, Peking University).
